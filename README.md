# 🧠 Serenity — Live Autism Stress Detection & Mitigation

**Developed at Cal Hacks 12.0 by Mahdi Alsalami, Cole Hartman, and Andrew Le**

Serenity is a **wearable EEG-based feedback and analytics system** designed to help caregivers and autistic individuals detect, understand, and manage stress in real time.  
By translating brainwave data into calming audio-visual experiences, Serenity bridges the gap between neuroscience and emotional support.

## Problem

Caregivers of individuals with autism often struggle to recognize early signs of anxiety or overstimulation.  
By the time visible symptoms appear, the individual may already be overwhelmed — leading to meltdowns, exhaustion, or shutdowns.  

**Key challenges:**
- Hard to identify triggers or emotional trends.
- No real-time insights into mental state.
- Limited tools for immediate, sensory-safe calming feedback.

## 💡 Solution

Serenity uses EEG brainwave data from a Muse headband to track **Alpha, Beta, and Theta** waves in real time.  
Through **cognitive state mapping**, the system recognizes patterns of stress and initiates adaptive visuals and soundscapes to restore calm.

### Core Features
- 🧠 **Live Dashboard:** Real-time EEG graph visualization (Alpha, Beta, Ratio).  
- 🎨 **Serenity Mode:** Dynamic visuals and 528Hz soundscapes that reduce sensory overload.  
- 📊 **History & Trends:** View long-term emotional patterns to improve care strategies.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Insights:** Claude analyzes EEG patterns to provide adaptive feedback and recommendations.

## Impact

**For autistic individuals:**  
- Reduces sensory overload through calming visuals and sounds.  
- Brings back focus and calm using gentle, adaptive feedback.  
- Encourages independence by helping users manage stress early.  

**For caregivers:**  
- Provides clear insight into emotional and stress patterns.  
- Enables early intervention before meltdowns occur.  
- Strengthens communication and understanding.  

> *Serenity helps autistic individuals feel calm, confident, and understood.*
